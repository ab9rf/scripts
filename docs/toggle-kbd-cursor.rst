    :summary: Toggles the keyboard cursor.
    :tags: adventure fort interface

This tool simply toggles the keyboard cursor so you can quickly switch it on
when you need it. Many other tools, like `autodump`, need a keyboard cursor for
selecting a target tile. Note that you'll still need to enter an interface mode
where the keyboard cursor is visible, like mining mode or dumping mode, in
order to use the cursor. In adventure mode, this tool toggles look mode via
simulated input.
